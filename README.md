# Heart Attack Prediction
Implement the following classification algorithms in Python and Compare the accuracies of all these algorithms.  
1> Logistic Regression  
2> Baye's Classifier / Naive Baye's Classifier  
3> Support Vector Machine. 
#### Draw the graphs depicting the comparison of accuracies.
