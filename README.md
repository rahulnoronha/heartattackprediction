# Heart Attack Prediction
Implement the following classification algorithms in Python and Compare the accuracies of all these algorithms.  
1> Logistic Regression  
2> Baye's Classifier / Naive Baye's Classifier  
3> K-Nearest Neighbors  
4> Decision Tree  
5> Support Vector Machine. 
#### Draw the graphs depicting the comparison of accuracies.
<hr/>

We implement these algorithms for the Heart Attack Prediction task on the data found below.
